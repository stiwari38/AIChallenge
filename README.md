 The goal of this challenge is to build a question answering (QA) system on top the Tax Guide. A successful QA interface to the Tax Guide will prove that replacing the current manual process with a question answering system based on user natural language is possible. Furthermore, it will allow scaling this capability for the other sections of the US Tax guide, and other tax guide. In addition, this will also enhance our applied knowledge of AI, NLP and other digital technologies.
